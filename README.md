I mostly use github to make [my website](https://asphy.dev).
Some other projects I've made include:
* [Bloxburg Ban Yourself Script](https://pastebin.com/2Ta1wPuj)
* [Bloxburg FE Invisible Car Script](https://pastebin.com/xnCs2B5B)
* [A Low Quality Bloxburg Pet Update](https://pastebin.com/quz5eer4)
* [Adapted a codepen to be synced to Beethoven](https://asphy.dev/onlyparticles)
* [An obfuscator that turns your JS into thin air](https://asphy.dev/generator)

I don't really do much else here. More projects on [my pastebin](https://pastebin.com/u/asphyixii).
